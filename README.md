# 🚀 PHPulse

PHPulse is an experimental PHP framework designed specifically for constructing desktop applications. 🌐 While currently in its proof-of-concept stage, it's important to note that using PHPulse for production development is not recommended at this time.

## 🛠️ Supported Platforms

- ✅ Windows
- ❌ Linux
- ❌ Mac OS

## 🧰 Tools Utilized

- PHP
- Electron

## 🚦 Project Overview

PHPulse combines the power of PHP and Electron to create desktop applications efficiently. With support for Windows and future plans for Linux and Mac OS, it aims to provide a versatile platform for developers.

## ⏱️ Development Timeline

This current implementation took approximately 36 minutes to develop. 🕒

So far I have thought of two effective ways to reimplement this projects which I am stil exploring.

The current version reflects **none** exploration of two reimplementations. Future developments will focus on refining and choosing the most efficient approaches that I am thinking of.

## 🚧 Roadmap

As the project evolves, it's important to note that the direct use of PHP binary files will undergo significant changes and will likely be removed to avoid any redundancies and application conflicts to the consumers machine.
